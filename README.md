# VA-Cincinnati-Resident-Algorithm


This is a repository of the source code of a script written in Javascript and HTML.

At the Cincinnati VA, we created a process to assign  patients admitted overnight based
on the number of patients each medicine team has.

The script is designed to automatically determine which patient goes to which team, saving
the night internal medicine residents from having to figure it out by hand!
